        <h3>Jonathan "Lazy Wolf" Wolffe</h3>
        <p>A former contract killer, ethical arms dealer, and now co-founder and owner of the bar. He took early retirement int order to make somwhere peaceful to settle down and write his memoirs. He certainly did not expect to become the surrogate father of a crazy, dysfunctional family.</p>

        <h3>Pixx Firecracker</h3>
        <p>Hailing from a distant fairytale dimension, when a quester she was guiding accidentally cast the wrong spell and opened a wormhole, she was sucked through and ended up at Lazy's Hole, shortly after it had opened. Fortunte timing, as she was quite bored at home and longed for a change- something that's impossible in her homeworld. Unfortunately she did also bring with her her addiction to "sherbet", a naturally occuring sugar found in the sugarcanes of her homeworld. To humans, it would be like experiencing a mild sugar-rush, though to her species, it's mrore like the effects of cocaine.</p>
